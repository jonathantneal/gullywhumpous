Move through sound and music.

---

I have a confession.

A few years ago, I wanted to hide some beacons on the Haunted Mansion, and I wanted to make an app that knew where I was along the ride.
From the app, I could choose all new soundtracks. Earbuds in; now I’m on the Dance, Rock, or even Home Tour versions of the attraction.
Except I didn’t want to break park rules. And I wanted to write my own soundtrack worthy of Disney approval. So I dreamed and dreamed.
BPM matched music and sound cues would eb and flow along ones’ journey. And why stop at the Haunted Mansion? And so I dreamed some more.

I used to take people to the Blue Bayou just to pitch my dream, surrounded by the “magic”. But 5 years into dreaming I was no closer.
Then one day, I realized I was actually a lot closer. I’d learned to code, and I’d [invested](https://github.com/10up/flexibility) [myself](https://github.com/jonathantneal/svg4everybody) [really](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) [deeply](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate) in the open web.
And I knew that good ideas and good projects take time, but they don’t need to have all the answers before they begin their adventure.
And I didn’t need to hide beacons or break park rules. I could start slowly. I could start 5 years later, because that day was today.

So I’m starting this project, and it’s very simple. It uses the language of the web to play you sound and music based on your location.
The music play in sync with other music, but everyone experiences it slightly different as we each move through time and space.
Maybe it uses paths and shapes to position where and when different sounds and music play or how they’re experienced as you get closer.

Whether it’s been dreamed or done before, I’m excited to learn, to build, and mostly excited to share with the world just as [Walt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney) [did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FiwXEgvpK0).
And whether I build this alone or with the help of other generous developers, I’m taking my first step and making my dream come true.
So Walt, Imagineers, web developers, friends, and the Monte Cristo sandwich; thanks for inspiring dreams and thanks for inspiring this.
